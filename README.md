# ! CHESS !
I'm just trying to code "Chess" in my way, no tutorials, no external references, just coding it as how i understand :D. Not sure how to do the checkmate thing, so you lose only when your king dies, simple.

# How to play:
*-to get started run CHESS_MAIN.py,*

*the coord system goes from 0 to 7 for move and selection, A1 C6 or coords like that aren't made yet,*

*The top pieces are Black team, the bottom ones are White team,*
